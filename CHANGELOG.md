# Changelog

## [0.2.16] - Unreleased

### Added
- **Game automation API (phase 2)** — 10 new `gd debug` subcommands for driving a running game by node name/path:
  - `describe` — AI-readable snapshot: player position, nearby nodes with class/groups/distance, current scene, input actions. Auto-detects common player names, adjusts radius for 2D vs 3D.
  - `find` — locate nodes by `--name` (recursive), `--type` (class), or `--group`.
  - `get-prop` — read a property value by node name/path or object ID.
  - `set` — set a property using GDScript expressions (`Vector2(100, 200)`, `"Game Over"`, `200`). No object ID needed.
  - `call` — invoke a method on a node with JSON args array.
  - `navigate` — pathfind via NavigationAgent2D/3D. Sets target, polls until arrival or timeout. The game's own movement code handles physics and animations.
  - `await` — poll until a condition is met: node exists/removed, property `--equals`/`--gt`/`--lt`/`--contains`. Configurable `--timeout` and `--interval`.
  - `mouse-move` — move cursor to screen coordinates or a node's screen position (renamed from `move-to`).
  - `mouse-drag` — multi-step cursor drag between coordinates or nodes (renamed from `drag`).
  - `mouse-hover` — hover cursor over a node/position with configurable dwell time (renamed from `hover`).

### Fixed
- **Node2D screen position** — `mouse-move`/`mouse-drag`/`mouse-hover` targeting a Node2D now apply the viewport canvas transform, so coordinates are correct when a Camera2D has panned or zoomed.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **`gd resource` command** — full CRUD API for `.tres` resource files (7 subcommands): `create`, `set-property`, `get-property`, `remove-property`, `set-script`, `remove-script`, `info`. All write commands support `--dry-run`. Create supports `--script` to attach a script at creation time.
- **StringName (`&"..."`) parse fix** — `.tscn`/`.tres` files containing `&"StringName"` literals now parse correctly. Previously tree-sitter byte offsets were misaligned when `&"` was normalized, causing mangled property values in `gd check`, `gd tree --scene`, `gd lsp scene-info`, and `gd resource info`.
- **LSP hover after dot** — `obj.method` now resolves the receiver's type and shows hover for the member on that type. Handles typed vars, `:=` inferred vars, autoloads, workspace `class_name` refs, and ClassDB inheritance chains.
- **LSP completions for local variable types** — `:=` inferred variables now resolve their type from constructor calls (`ClassName.new()`), class constants (`Vector2.ZERO`), builtin constructors (`Vector2(...)`), same-file function return types (`_get_direction() -> Vector2`), and literals.
- **LSP completions for for-loop typed iterators** — `for npc: Node2D in ...` now provides Node2D members when completing `npc.`.
- **LSP autoload completions** — `EventBus.`, `PokemonDB.` and other autoload singletons now return script-defined signals, methods, and properties plus inherited ClassDB members.
- **LSP Signal member completions** — `signal.emit()`, `.connect()`, `.disconnect()`, etc. now appear when completing after a signal name (e.g. `self.my_signal.` or `EventBus.player_moved.`).
- **LSP workspace class_name + autoload index** — `WorkspaceIndex` now indexes `class_name` declarations and `project.godot` autoloads for O(1) lookups.
- **LSP hover for engine singletons** — bare `Input`, `OS`, `Engine` etc. now show `class Input` on hover.
- **`--hold` for input commands** — `gd debug press/key/click --hold <seconds>` holds the input for a duration instead of a single-frame tap. Uses Rust-side sleep so the game processes physics frames during the hold. Essential for 3D games where single-frame presses barely register.
- **`--delay` for type command** — `gd debug type --delay <ms>` adds a delay between each character for more realistic typing.
- **Orphaned game cleanup** — when the daemon detects a binary rebuild (build_id mismatch), it now kills the orphaned game process before spawning a new daemon. Uses platform-native kill on all platforms (WSL: tasklist.exe + taskkill.exe, Linux/macOS: SIGTERM/SIGKILL, Windows: TerminateProcess).

### Fixed
- **LSP hover name collisions** — hovering on `obj.method` where `method` also exists in the current file now correctly resolves to the receiver's type instead of the local declaration.
- **LSP hover for method calls** — `obj.method()` (with parentheses) now resolves hover via tree-sitter `attribute_call` traversal, not just property access.
- **Eval ID collisions** — rapid-fire eval commands within 1ms got the same timestamp ID, causing overwrites. Now uses compound IDs (`{timestamp}-{pid}-{counter}`) with an atomic counter.
- **Per-ID eval request files** — changed from single `gd-eval-request.gd` (concurrent evals overwrite each other) to `gd-eval-request-{id}.gd` per request. GDScript server scans directory for any matching file.
- **Stale eval file cleanup** — `gd-eval-ready`, `gd-eval-request-*`, and `gd-eval-result-*` files are now cleaned up when the game exits or the daemon restarts.
- **Eval works during tree pause** — eval Timer and runner Node both set to `PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS`, so `gd eval` works while `SceneTree.paused = true`.
- **WSL game not killed on daemon restart** — `kill_daemon()` was sending Linux `kill` to a WSL shim PID instead of using `tasklist.exe`/`taskkill.exe` to find and kill the actual Windows Godot process.
- **Stale eval timeout cascading** — purge all `gd-eval-request-*` and `gd-eval-result-*` files before each new eval to prevent the eval server from processing leftover requests from timed-out evals. Ready file now validates PID liveness.
- **`gd lsp create-file` ignoring stdin** — piped content via `cat ... | gd lsp create-file --file <path>` was ignored, creating a bare stub file instead. Now checks `is_stdin_readable()` like other refactoring commands.
- **`gd scene attach-script` path resolution** — failed with "Script file not found" when run from a subdirectory. Now resolves relative paths against both CWD and project root, and strips `res://` prefixes.

### Changed
- **Human-readable defaults for all commands** — 22 LSP subcommands (refactoring, scene-info, find-implementations, diagnostics, code-actions) and `gd resource info` now default to concise human-readable output. Use `--format json` for structured output. Saves tokens for AI agents and is easier to scan for humans.
- **Eval server enabled by default** — `gd run` now starts the eval server automatically. `gd eval` and `gd debug` input commands work without any extra flags. Use `--bare` to opt out.
- **Eval output uses file redirect** — eval-without-log mode now redirects Godot's stdout/stderr to the log file via `Stdio::from(File)` instead of pipes, preventing broken-pipe crashes on WSL when the parent process exits.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Game liveness detection** — the daemon now checks every 5 seconds whether the game process is still alive. If the game crashes or exits without `gd stop`, the daemon automatically clears `game_running` and `game_pid` state instead of staying stuck forever.
- **Debug TCP disconnect callback** — when the game's debug TCP connection drops, the daemon immediately clears game state. Combined with liveness polling, this provides both instant and fallback detection.
- **Single-instance daemon (`flock`)** — the daemon now acquires an exclusive file lock (`.godot/gd-daemon.lock`) on startup. A second `gd daemon serve` for the same project exits with a clear error instead of silently competing.
- **Enriched `gd daemon status`** — response now includes `game_pid` and `debug_connected` fields alongside the existing `game_running`.
- **Platform-native process management** — `libc` (Unix) and `windows-sys` (Windows) replace shell-out to `kill`/`taskkill` for process liveness checks and game termination.
- **Faster WSL game stop** — replaced slow PowerShell `Get-CimInstance` lookup with `tasklist.exe /FI /FO CSV` for finding the Windows Godot PID.

### Changed
- **Unified game state** — `game_running` (AtomicBool) and `game_pid` (Mutex) merged into a single `game_state: Arc<Mutex<Option<GameInfo>>>`. Eliminates the class of bugs where one was set but the other wasn't.
- **Idle monitor interval** — reduced from 30s to 5s for faster crash detection and idle exit.

### Fixed
- **Daemon stuck after game crash** — the `game_running` flag stayed true forever when the game exited without `gd stop`, blocking idle timeout and confusing agents/scripts polling `gd daemon status`.
- **Stale PID accumulation** — `game_pid` was never cleared on unexpected game exit, leaving the state file pointing at a dead or reused PID.
- **`lsp_cmd.rs` Windows FFI** — replaced hand-rolled `extern "system" { fn GetFileType }` with proper `windows-sys` bindings.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Context-aware dot-completions** — typing `self.`, `sprite.`, or `Vector2.` now returns only members of the receiver type instead of the full 500+ global list. Resolves `self`/`super`, typed variables (top-level and local), function parameters, engine classes, builtin types, and workspace class names.
- **ClassDB properties** — extracted 4055 properties from Godot's `extension_api.json` into the class database. New `class_properties()` walks inheritance. Dot-completions show both methods and properties.
- **Human-readable LSP query output** — `gd lsp references/definition/hover/completions/symbols` now default to `--format human` with colored, tabular output. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output.
- **Enum member hover** — hovering over enum members shows computed values (e.g. `Color.RED = 0`), handles explicit and implicit value calculation.
- **Keyword hover** — hovering on `var`, `func`, `const`, `signal`, `class`, `enum` keywords (not just the name) now shows the declaration.
- **Input automation commands** — `gd debug click/press/key/type/wait/screenshot` for game input automation via live eval (experimental).
- **Shared live eval module** — extracted `send_eval()` to `src/core/live_eval.rs` for reuse by eval and input commands.
- **Completions `--kind` filter** — filter completion results by kind (function, method, variable, property, etc.).

## [0.2.12] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **LSP hover doc comments** — hovering over user-defined functions, variables, constants, signals, enums, and classes now shows `##` doc comments in the hover popup.
- **LSP completion doc comments** — completion items for user-defined symbols now include `##` doc comments in the documentation field.
- **Symbol table doc extraction** — `##` doc comments are parsed and stored on `FuncDecl`, `VarDecl`, `SignalDecl`, and `EnumDecl` in the symbol table, propagated to workspace index.

### Fixed
- **`replace-symbol` on `class_name` duplicated content** — replacing a symbol found via `class_name_statement` now replaces the entire file instead of just the `class_name` line, preventing old content from being appended below.
- **`naming-convention` false positive on private constants** — constants with leading underscores (e.g. `_DIALOG_BOX_SCRIPT`) are now correctly recognized as valid `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **`gd fmt` collapsed multiline enums** — enums written across multiple lines are now preserved as multiline, matching the existing behavior for arrays and dictionaries.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **`gd scene create`** — create new `.tscn` scene files with `--root-type` and optional `--root-name` (defaults to PascalCase of filename).
- **`gd scene add-node`** — add nodes to a scene with `--name`, `--type`, and optional `--parent` (defaults to root).
- **`gd scene remove-node`** — remove a node and all its descendants, with cascading cleanup of connections and orphaned ext_resources.
- **`gd scene set-property`** — set or update a property on any node (pass-through Godot resource format values).
- **`gd scene add-connection`** / **`gd scene remove-connection`** — add or remove signal connections with `--signal`, `--from`, `--to`, `--method`.
- **`gd scene detach-script`** — remove a script from a node, with automatic cleanup of orphaned ext_resources and load_steps.
- All scene commands support `--dry-run` to preview changes without writing.

### Changed
- `scene_cmd.rs` split into a directory module (`scene_cmd/`) with 8 submodules for maintainability.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **`gd eval`** — evaluate GDScript expressions, statements, or full scripts. Supports inline (`gd eval "1+1"`), file (`gd eval script.gd`), and stdin (`cat file.gd | gd eval -`). Offline mode launches headless Godot; live mode evaluates against a running game.
- **`gd run --eval`** — start the game with an embedded eval server. Enables `gd eval` to run arbitrary GDScript against the live game (query state, mutate objects, add nodes in real-time).
- **`gd test --runner`** — explicitly select test framework (`gut`, `gdunit4`, or `script`) instead of relying on auto-detection.
- **Eval sandbox** — blocks dangerous APIs (`OS.execute`, `HTTPClient`, `Thread`, etc.) and restricts `FileAccess`/`DirAccess` to `res://` and `user://` paths. Use `--unsafe` to bypass.
- **Escape sanitization** — auto-strips invalid GDScript escape sequences (e.g. `\!` → `!`) before sending to Godot, preventing silent crashes.
- **Syntax-highlighted eval output** — scripts sent via live eval are printed with line numbers and keyword/string/number coloring.

### Fixed
- **Stdin consumed twice in `gd eval -`** — piped input was read by the live eval path, then the offline fallback tried to re-read empty stdin. Now reads once and reuses.
- **Daemon state lost after rebuild** — rebuilding `gd` auto-restarted the daemon (build ID mismatch), losing eval server tracking. Now falls back to checking the `gd-eval-ready` file directly.
- **Eval timer killed by cleanup scripts** — the polling timer was auto-named `@Timer@2` and caught by `@`-prefix cleanup. Now named `GdEvalTimer`.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **`class-definitions-order` false positives** — `@rpc` annotations and `@export_group`/`@export_category`/`@export_subgroup` are no longer miscategorized as file-level headers. Only `@tool`, `@icon`, `@static_unload` are treated as headers; export grouping annotations are treated as export vars; `@rpc` and others are skipped.
- **`gd fmt` preserves inline `# gd:ignore` comments** — trailing comments on `signal`, `var`, `const`, `extends`, `class_name`, `return`, and assignment statements are no longer moved to a separate line, which previously broke lint suppression.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **`gd env`** — show environment info (gd version, Godot version/path, OS, arch, WSL, project root, config path). Supports `--json`.
- **Updated `gd llm`** — command reference now covers all 30 commands including debug, scene, log, env, and lint categories.

### Fixed
- **`gd debug eval` now works without a manual breakpoint** — previously always failed because the `break` command pauses the engine without entering the GDScript debug loop. Now automatically sets a temporary breakpoint on a `_process` function, evaluates, then cleans up. Assignments, node paths, builtins, and multi-expression all work.
- **Eval text output** — fixed raw JSON leaking into display for all types; Array and Dictionary values now render as `[1, true, null]` and `{key: value}` instead of nested variant JSON.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd scene attach-script`** — attach a GDScript file to a node in a `.tscn` scene. Auto-increments `ext_resource` ID, updates `load_steps`, supports `--node <name>` and `--dry-run`.
- **`gd run --log`** — stream Godot's stdout/stderr to the terminal for debugging print output and error backtraces
- **`gd log`** — view game output from the last `gd run`. Supports `--tail N`, `--follow` (real-time), and `--clear`.
- **Always-capture game logs** — `gd run` now always writes Godot's stdout/stderr to `.godot/gd-game.log`, even without `--log`. When `--log` is set, output is tee'd to both the terminal and the log file.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **New lint rule: `enum-name-collision`** (75 → 76 total) — detects when an inner enum name collides with a global `class_name` in the project, which causes Godot type resolution errors

### Fixed
- `gd check` now detects `:=` Variant inference from polymorphic builtins (`max`, `min`, `clamp`, `snapped`, `wrap`)
- Type inference engine now correctly returns Variant for polymorphic builtins (typed variants like `maxi`/`maxf` still return their specific types)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Lint categories** — 8 categories for bulk rule control: `correctness`, `suspicious`, `style`, `complexity`, `performance`, `godot`, `type_safety`, `maintenance`. Each of the 76 rules belongs to exactly one category.
- **Category config in `[lint]`** — set `type_safety = "warning"` to enable all type-safety rules (including opt-in), `maintenance = "off"` to disable all maintenance rules, etc.
- **5-level severity resolution** — disabled_rules > per-rule severity > per-rule config > category level > rule default

### Changed
- `gd init` template rewritten to be minimal with category examples
- README lint section reorganized by category with bulk-control documentation

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Cross-file resolution engine** (`src/core/workspace_index.rs`) — Layer 3: project-wide symbol index that maps `class_name` declarations to their symbols, parses `project.godot` autoloads, and resolves `preload()` targets. Built once at lint time, shared read-only across parallel file linting.
- **3 new lint rules** (72 → 75 total):
  - `shadowed-variable-base-class` (opt-in) — local variable shadows a member of a user-defined base class
  - `static-called-on-instance` (default-on) — static method called on `self` or typed instance instead of the class
  - `missing-tool` (opt-in) — base class has `@tool` but this script does not
- **Enhanced existing rules with cross-file awareness:**
  - `return-value-discarded` — now detects user-defined non-void functions across files
  - `unsafe-void-return` — now detects user-defined void functions across files
  - `native-method-override` — now checks user-defined base class methods, not just ClassDB
- **Project-aware type inference** — `infer_expression_type_with_project()` resolves method return types from user-defined base classes before falling back to ClassDB

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- **Remove image processing dependencies** — removed `base64`, `png`, and `jpeg-encoder` crates. Screenshot commands now return PNG file paths instead of base64-encoded data. Reduces binary size by ~240 KB.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Expression type inference engine** (`src/core/type_inference.rs`) — Layer 2: infer types of any GDScript expression. Handles literals, constructors, builtin functions, self/ClassDB method calls (walks inheritance chain), operators, comparisons, casts, ternary, identifiers, subscript, and `$`/`get_node`.
- **ClassDB `method_return_type()`** — resolve return types for 16,346 engine methods with inheritance chain walking.
- **7 new lint rules** (65 → 72 total):
  - `narrowing-conversion` (opt-in, fixable) — float expression assigned to int-typed variable
  - `unsafe-void-return` (opt-in, fixable) — returning or assigning a void function call result
  - `return-value-discarded` (opt-in) — non-void call result unused as expression statement
  - `incompatible-ternary` (opt-in) — ternary branches have incompatible types
  - `standalone-ternary` (default-on) — ternary expression used as statement with result unused
  - `assert-always-true` (opt-in, fixable) — `assert(true)`, `assert(1)`, `assert("string")`
  - `assert-always-false` (opt-in, fixable) — `assert(false)`, `assert(0)`, `assert(null)`
- 4 new auto-fixes (13 → 17 fixable rules): `narrowing-conversion` wraps with `int()`, `unsafe-void-return` splits return/removes var, `assert-always-true/false` deletes assertion line
- Refactored `static-type-inference`, `variant-inference`, and `untyped-array-literal` to use centralized inference engine (same diagnostics, consolidated implementation)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Symbol table** (`src/core/symbol_table.rs`) — per-file declaration-level type tracking built from tree-sitter ASTs. Extracts variables, functions, signals, enums, constants, annotations (`@tool`, `@onready`, `@export`, etc.), `class_name`, `extends`, inner classes, and type annotations.
- **6 new symbol-table-aware lint rules** (all opt-in):
  - `onready-with-export` (error) — `@onready` and `@export` on the same variable conflict at runtime
  - `enum-variable-without-default` (warning) — enum-typed variable without default will be `0`, not the first enum member
  - `redundant-static-unload` (warning) — `@static_unload` annotation with no static variables to unload
  - `get-node-default-without-onready` (error) — `$`/`get_node()` in variable default without `@onready`
  - `unused-private-class-variable` (warning) — `_`-prefixed variable declared but never referenced
  - `native-method-override` (error) — function name shadows a method inherited from an engine class
- Lint pipeline now builds symbol table once per file and passes it to all rules via `check_with_symbols()`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-14

### Breaking
- **Debug API grouping** — flat `gd debug <cmd>` commands reorganized into nested subcommand groups:
  - `gd debug scene tree` (was `scene-tree`), `gd debug scene inspect` (was `inspect`), `gd debug scene inspect-objects`, `gd debug scene camera-view`
  - `gd debug camera screenshot` (was `screenshot`), `gd debug camera override` (was `override-camera`), `gd debug camera transform-2d`, `gd debug camera transform-3d`
  - `gd debug live set-root` (was `live-set-root`), `gd debug live create-node`, etc.
  - `gd debug select type` (was `node-select-type`), `gd debug select clear` (was `clear-selection`), etc.
  - Top-level commands (`stop`, `continue`, `next`, `step-in`, `step-out`, `breakpoint`, `stack`, `vars`, `eval`, `set-prop`, `suspend`, etc.) remain unchanged

### Added
- **`enum-without-class-name` lint rule** (opt-in) — warns when a script defines a named enum but has no `class_name`, and a type annotation references that enum. Godot qualifies such enums as `filename.gd.EnumName`, so bare `EnumName` annotations fail to resolve.
- **`variant-inference` now detects compound expressions** — catches `:=` on binary/comparison operators (`dict["key"] == "switch"`), parenthesized expressions (`(dict["key"])`), and unary operators (`not dict["key"]`) that contain Variant-producing sub-expressions. Previously only direct subscript and method calls were detected.
- `gd check` mirrors the same Variant detection improvements (binary, parenthesized, unary)

## [0.1.31] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- **Enforce `clippy::pedantic`** — deny-level pedantic lints across the entire codebase. Fixed 460+ violations (redundant closures, manual `is_empty`, needless borrows, `match` vs `if let`, etc.).
- **Remove DAP client** — stripped `dap_client.rs` and all DAP-specific code paths. The binary debug protocol (`godot_debug_server`) is the sole debug transport.
- **Split 7 god files into 43 submodules** — `debug_cmd` (10), `daemon` (6), `variant` (4), `test_cmd` (5), `godot_debug_server` (7), `printer` (6), `query` (5). No public API changes; all items re-exported from `mod.rs`. Every file now under 750 lines.

## [0.1.30] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd debug camera-view`** — show active camera info and all spatial node transforms in the running game. Detects cameras by engine class, script path, or node name (case-insensitive). Script classes (`res://...`) are included as spatial candidates and filtered by actual transform properties.
- **`gd debug screenshot`** — capture game viewport as JPEG (base64 via debug protocol, PNG→JPEG conversion). Supports `--output <file>` to save to disk.
- **`gd debug set-var`** — modify local variables at breakpoints (name + value + stack frame)
- **`gd debug inspect --rich`** — enrich output with ClassDB docs: class descriptions, property documentation, Godot docs URLs. Walks the full inheritance chain.
- **Property enrichment** — `inspect --rich` now resolves enum values to names, adds range metadata, and annotates type/resource hints from ClassDB

### Fixed
- **Debug server mutex deadlock** — all daemon dispatch functions now clone an `Arc<GodotDebugServer>` and release the daemon mutex before executing. Previously, long-running operations (batch inspect, accept) held the mutex for 10-30s, blocking all other debug queries and causing cascading timeouts.
- **Batch inspect reliability** — `cmd_inspect_objects` now issues individual inspect commands per object instead of a single batch send. Prevents one missing/freed object from breaking the entire batch.
- **`set-prop` with Vector3 values** — fixed `json_to_variant` catch-all that silently converted arrays/objects to Nil. Now maps JSON arrays by element count to Vector2/3/4/Transform/Basis/Projection, and JSON objects support typed wrappers like `{"Vector3": [1,2,3]}`.
- **`set-prop-field` sub-field assignment** — rewrote to use client-side inspect→modify→set instead of Godot's broken `fieldwise_assign` (which casts scalar values to the property type, zeroing sub-fields).
- **`eval` return values** — fixed 3-field vs 4-field parsing of Godot's `evaluation_return` protocol (was returning variant type ID instead of actual value).
- **Daemon kill race condition** — `kill_daemon` now polls for process exit (up to 2s) instead of a fixed 200ms sleep, preventing port conflicts on restart.
- **`accept()` interruptible** — debug server accept loop checks the `running` flag so server replacement interrupts pending accepts within ~50ms.
- **Screenshot size** — PNG→JPEG conversion (quality 80) via `png` + `jpeg-encoder` crates instead of raw PNG base64.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd llm`** — AI-readable command reference (like llms.txt for websites). Prints the full command tree in a compressed format for LLM context windows — 204 lines covering every command, flag, and pattern.
- **`gd debug inspect --rich`** — enrich inspect output with ClassDB documentation (class descriptions, property docs, Godot docs URLs). Walks the inheritance chain (e.g. CharacterBody3D → Node3D → Node → Object).
- `src/debug/enrich.rs` — loosely coupled enrichment module (JSON in → JSON out, easy to remove)

## [0.1.28] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd stop`** — top-level command to terminate the running game (mirrors `gd run`)
  - `gd debug stop` also works as an alias
  - WSL-aware: uses PowerShell + taskkill.exe to find and kill the Windows Godot process
  - Game PID persisted in daemon state file — `gd stop` works even if daemon has died
- **`gd debug inspect --brief`** — stripped-down output for AI: just `{name: value}` pairs, no Godot internals (hint, hint_string, type_id, usage)
- **`gd debug breakpoint --name <func>`** — resolve function name to file:line automatically (searches project .gd files)
- **`gd debug breakpoint --condition <expr>`** — condition metadata stored with breakpoint (server-side enforcement coming later)
- **`gd debug next` aliased as `gd debug step-over`** — symmetry with `step-in`/`step-out`

### Changed
- `gd debug suspend --resume` → `gd debug suspend --off` — consistent with `mute-audio --off`, `skip-breakpoints --off`, etc.
- `gd debug inspect` strips `Members/` and `Constants/` prefixes from property names — property names now match what `set-prop` expects
- `gd run` now always wires `--remote-debug` silently (no user-facing port args) — enables `gd debug` without manual setup
- `gd run` output cleaned up — single status line instead of raw JSON dump

### Fixed
- `gd daemon status` now correctly shows `game_running: true` when a game is connected via binary debug protocol (was only set for DAP launches)
- `gd stop` / `gd debug stop` clears the `game_running` flag in daemon state

## [0.1.27] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd daemon`** — top-level command for daemon lifecycle management
  - `gd daemon status` — show daemon connectivity and state
  - `gd daemon stop` — stop the background daemon
  - `gd daemon restart` — restart the daemon (stop + auto-spawn on next query)
  - Moved from `gd lsp daemon-*` namespace since the daemon is no longer LSP-specific
- **WSL path translation** — `gd run` and `gd build` now work transparently from WSL with a Windows Godot binary
  - `find_godot()` resolves Windows paths in `gd.toml`/`GODOT_PATH` on WSL (auto-converts `C:\...` to `/mnt/c/...` for existence checks)
  - `--path` argument auto-converted from `/mnt/c/...` to `C:/...` when spawning a `.exe` binary
  - Daemon cache lookup: discovers Godot path from previous DAP launches
  - Clear error message on WSL when no Windows Godot binary is configured
- **Daemon auto-restart** — build_id fingerprinting (version + binary mtime) auto-kills stale daemons after recompile
- **Game exit detection** — daemon auto-clears `game_running` flag when game process exits (no more stale state)

### Changed
- `gd run` simplified — non-blocking spawn (returns immediately instead of waiting for Godot to exit), removed DAP launch logic
- WSL path utilities consolidated into `src/core/fs.rs` (removed duplicates from run_cmd, daemon, debug_cmd)

## [0.1.26] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Godot binary debug protocol** — full implementation of Godot's native debug protocol (port 6007), enabling direct game introspection beyond what DAP supports
  - `src/debug/variant.rs` — binary codec for all 39 Godot Variant types (Nil through PackedVector4Array)
  - `src/debug/godot_debug_server.rs` — TCP server speaking the binary protocol (length-prefixed Variant-encoded packets)
- `gd debug scene-tree` — show the running game's live scene tree (node names, classes, object IDs)
- `gd debug inspect --id <N>` — inspect a scene node's properties by object ID
- `gd debug set-prop --id <N> --property <name> --value <val>` — set a property on a scene node at runtime
- `gd debug suspend [--off]` — freeze/resume the game loop
- `gd debug next-frame` — advance one physics frame while suspended
- `gd debug time-scale --scale <N>` — set Engine.time_scale (slow-mo, fast-forward)
- `gd debug reload-scripts` — hot-reload all GDScript files in the running game
- Interactive REPL commands: `scene-tree`/`tree`, `inspect`/`i`, `set-prop`, `suspend`, `resume`, `next-frame`/`nf`, `timescale`, `reload`
- All new commands support `--format json` for scripting

## [0.1.25] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `gd debug step-out` — step out of the current function (synthetic: repeats `next` until stack depth decreases, same technique as the official VS Code plugin)
- `gd debug --format json` on all stepping commands (`continue`, `next`, `step`, `step-out`, `pause`) — JSON output includes stack frames and full variable scopes
- `gd debug set-var --format json` — returns `{name, value, type, input}` for automation
- Client-side conditional breakpoints — `gd debug break --condition <expr>` now evaluates the expression on each hit and auto-continues when false (Godot's DAP ignores conditions natively)
- `--name` with `--file` scoping for ambiguous function names — errors with candidate list when multiple files define the same function
- Type inference for `set-var` — populates type field from value when Godot returns empty type (int, float, bool, String, constructors)

### Fixed
- `--name` now resolves to the first executable statement inside the function body (not the `func` declaration line, which Godot won't break on)
- Condition evaluator correctly parses boolean results (`"false"`, `"0"`, `"null"` → falsy; everything else → truthy)
- `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=` in eval expressions no longer trigger false assignment warnings
- `set-var` on local variables gives clear error: "Godot's DAP does not support setting locals"
- `set-var` and `eval` output JSON errors to stderr when `--format json` is active
- Daemon DAP recovery: failed operations set `dap_needs_reconnect` flag, next query auto-reconnects
- Daemon disconnect uses TCP shutdown to prevent stream corruption after failed operations
- String values in `set-var` correctly auto-quoted (bare words like `bike` become `"bike"`)

## [0.1.24] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `gd debug set-var --name <var> --value <val>` — modify variable values while paused at a breakpoint

## [0.1.23] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Background daemon** — persistent process maintains Godot LSP and DAP connections, auto-starts on first CLI query, auto-exits after 5 min idle
  - `gd lsp daemon-status` — show daemon connectivity (Godot LSP, DAP, game state)
  - All hover, completion, and definition queries now route through the daemon for instant results
- `gd run` now launches the game via DAP when the Godot editor is open (returns immediately, falls back to direct spawn)
- `gd debug` — runtime debugging via Godot's Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)
  - `gd debug attach` — interactive REPL session
    - `break`, `clear`, `wait` — set/clear breakpoints and wait for hits
    - `continue`, `pause`, `next`, `step` — execution control
    - `stack`, `vars`, `expand` — inspect call stack and variables
    - `eval` — evaluate expressions at breakpoints (member-access only)
  - `gd debug break --file <path> --line <N>` — one-shot: set breakpoint, wait for hit, dump stack + variables (`--format json`)
  - `gd debug break --name <func>` — break on function entry by name (resolves to file:line automatically)
  - `gd debug break --condition <expr>` — conditional breakpoints (only trigger when expression is true)
  - `gd debug eval --expr <expr>` — evaluate expression while paused at a breakpoint (`--format json`)
  - `gd debug continue/next/step/pause` — non-interactive execution control
  - `gd debug status` — show DAP connection and threads (`--format json`)
  - `gd debug stop` — terminate the running game
  - Cross-platform path resolution (WSL `/mnt/c/` to `C:/` conversion)
- Static completions now include engine methods from class_db based on `extends` clause (e.g. `extends Node2D` adds `apply_scale`, `add_child`, etc.)

### Fixed
- Godot Dictionary errors from missing `name`/`checksums` fields in DAP source objects
- Godot Dictionary errors from missing `context.triggerKind` in LSP completion requests

## [0.1.22] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `.tscn`/`.tres` scene and resource file support:
  - `gd check` validates scene files — detects broken `res://` paths, orphaned `ext_resource` declarations, and parse errors
  - `gd deps --include-resources` includes `.tscn`/`.tres` files in the dependency graph
  - `gd tree --scene <file.tscn>` displays scene node hierarchy (text tree or `--format json`)
  - `gd tree --scene <directory>` lists all scenes in a directory
  - `gd lsp scene-info --file <scene.tscn>` returns structured JSON (nodes, ext_resources, connections)
  - `gd lsp scene-info --nodes-only` for compact node-only output
- Godot LSP proxy — forwards hover, completion, and go-to-definition to Godot's built-in LSP server (port 6005) when the editor is running
  - `gd lsp --godot-port <PORT>` to configure proxy port (default: 6005)
  - `gd lsp --no-godot-proxy` to disable proxy
  - Results are merged with static analysis (engine docs + local symbols)

### Changed

## [0.1.21] - 2026-02-13

### Changed
- `gd lsp view --format json` now returns a single `content` string instead of a per-line object array (~3x fewer tokens)

### Added
- `gd lsp view --range 5-20` shorthand for `--start-line 5 --end-line 20`
- `gd lsp edit-range --range 5-20` shorthand for `--start-line 5 --end-line 20`
- `gd lsp create-file --input-file` reads initial file content from a file (or stdin when piped) instead of generating boilerplate

## [0.1.20] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- `gd fmt` preserves multiline parenthesized expressions with comments (no longer collapses `# comment` into subsequent code)
- `gd fmt` places commas correctly before trailing comments in multiline arrays and dictionaries
- `gd fmt` properly handles line continuation (`\`) in arrays, dictionaries, binary operators, assignments, function parameters, and method chains

## [0.1.19] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- `gd check` no longer rejects `#region`/`#endregion` fold markers at the top level
- `gd check` no longer flags Godot enum type names (e.g. `Viewport.MSAA`) as unknown constants
- `gd fmt` preserves multiline arrays and dictionaries instead of collapsing them into single lines

## [0.1.18] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- `untyped-array-literal` auto-fix now infers `Array[Color]`, `Array[Vector2]`, etc. from homogeneous class member/constructor expressions (not just String/int/float/bool)

## [0.1.16] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Regenerate class database from full Godot 4.6 `extension_api.json` — 213 → 1024 classes, 5380 enum members, 16346 methods

  - `variant-inference` (opt-in) — warns on `:=` inferring Variant from dict/array access patterns
  - `look-at-before-tree` (opt-in) — detects tree-dependent method calls (`look_at`, `to_global`, etc.) before `add_child()`
  - `null-after-await` (opt-in) — warns on member variable access in `_process`/`_physics_process` without null guard after `await` assignment

- `gd lsp view` — read lines from a GDScript file with optional `--start-line`, `--end-line`, and `--context` (JSON output for AI tools)

### Fixed
- `gd lsp edit-range` on empty files no longer errors — correctly handles insert into empty/newline-only files
- `gd lsp change-signature` no longer inserts C-style `/* */` comments at call sites — uses default value or `null` placeholder with a warning

## [0.1.13] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- gdUnit4 test framework support in `gd test` — auto-detects `addons/gdUnit4/`, invokes GdUnitCmdTool, parses JUnit XML results

- `--input-file <path>` flag for `insert`, `replace-body`, `replace-symbol`, `edit-range` — read content from a file instead of stdin (fixes Windows pipe encoding issues with tabs)

### Fixed
- Hover on unresolvable identifiers inside a function no longer falls through to show the enclosing function signature
- Hover on declaration keywords (`func`, `var`, `const`, `signal`, `class`, `enum`) only triggers when cursor is on the name, not on body contents
