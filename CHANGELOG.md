# Changelog

## [0.2.23] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **`duplicate-variable` lint rule** (correctness, default-enabled) — detects duplicate `var` declarations at class scope. Catches cases like `replace-symbol` leaving stale declarations that Godot rejects at load time.
- **`native-method-override` signature checking** — now detects parameter type mismatches (e.g. `String` vs `NodePath`), return type mismatches (e.g. `String` vs `StringName`), and parameter count errors when overriding native methods. Previously only checked method name.
- **Method signatures in ClassDB** — `generate_class_db.py` now emits `METHOD_SIGNATURES` table with return type, required/total param counts, and param types for all engine methods.
- **`gd lsp move-file`** — move/rename a file and update all references (preload, load, ext_resource, project.godot autoloads) across the project. Supports `--dry-run` for preview.
- **`gd lsp create-file --force`** — overwrite an existing file intentionally (bypasses the existence check).

### Improved
- **Bevel spherical arc interpolation** — for circular profile (default 0.5), arc intermediates between beveled edges now use spherical interpolation on the bevel sphere instead of quadratic bezier. Eliminates the ~57% radius shortfall that caused concave pinch artifacts at corners. All cap vertices now sit at consistent distance from the original vertex.
- **Bevel corner patches** — when 3+ beveled edges meet at a vertex, cap fill now uses structured K-fold symmetric kite quads (S=2) or concentric sphere-projected rings (S≥3) instead of flat-centroid ring inset. Center vertex is projected onto the bevel sphere for smooth geometry.
- **Boolean annular quad bridging** — when a boolean cut creates a hole through a coplanar face (e.g. cylinder through cube), the annular region (outer square + inner circle) is now bridged with structured quad/tri strips instead of keeping ~112 starburst fragments. Produces clean radial edge flow suitable for bevel and subdivision.

### Fixed
- **`gd mesh create` fails on second invocation** — `queue_free()` on the old `_GdMeshHelper` node deferred deletion until end of frame, causing a name collision when the replacement node was added immediately. Godot auto-renamed the new node, making subsequent push scripts unable to find it. Fixed by using `remove_child()` before `queue_free()` to immediately free the name slot. Same fix applied to `_GdMeshGrid` overlay recreation.
- **`variant-inference`: detect `:=` with `in`/`not in` operator** — `var x := action in arr` now flags as a Variant inference error. Godot's parser treats `in`/`not in` as returning Variant even though it's always bool at runtime.
- **`gd check`: detect `:=` on unresolvable property access** — `var keycode := event.physical_keycode` (where `event` is typed as a base class like `InputEvent`) now flags as Variant inference error. Only triggers when the receiver is typed as a ClassDB class; builtin types (`Vector2.x`), `self`, and method calls are excluded.
- **`gd check`: detect `load().instantiate()` with `:=`** — `var x := load("res://scene.tscn").instantiate()` now flags as Variant inference error. `load()` returns `Resource` which has no `instantiate()` method; Godot rejects this at parse time. `preload()` is correctly excluded (Godot resolves it to `PackedScene`).
- **`gd check`: detect ClassDB Variant-return methods with `:=`** — `var meta := node.get_meta("key")` (where `node` is typed as a ClassDB class) now flags when the method returns `Variant` in ClassDB. Only triggers on typed receivers; untyped variables and `self` are excluded.
- **`look-at-before-tree`: detect `global_*` property assignments** — setting `global_position`, `global_rotation`, `global_rotation_degrees`, `global_transform`, or `global_basis` on a node before `add_child()` now triggers a warning. Previously the rule only caught method calls.
- **`gd resource set-property`: multi-line value replacement** — replacing a property with a multi-line value (arrays, dictionaries) now correctly removes all continuation lines instead of leaving orphaned fragments.
- **`gd scene set-property`: duplicate property on blank-line separator** — when a blank line separated the `[node]` header from existing properties, set-property inserted a duplicate instead of replacing. Fixed ordering so replacement always takes priority.
- **`gd scene set-property`: multi-line value replacement** — same multi-line consumption fix as resource set-property.

## [0.2.21] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Rust-native primitives** — cube, sphere, and cylinder are now built entirely in Rust with correct CCW winding. Godot becomes display-only; eliminates the CW/CCW winding mismatch that caused boolean normal inversions.
- **Boolean rewrite** — plane-based polygon splitting replaces the old triangle-triangle approach. Produces watertight output with quad-dominant topology. Pipeline: split → classify → T-junction repair → dissolve coplanar → quadrangulate n-gons → tag boundary edges.
- **N-gon quadrangulation** — boolean output n-gons (5+ vertices) are converted to quad-ring topology for clean bevel and subdivision behavior.
- **Coplanar edge dissolution** — fragments from plane-based splitting are merged back into larger polygons. Degenerate near-zero-area faces are unconditionally merged with neighbors.
- **Edge tagging for boolean boundaries** — boundary edges from boolean operations are tagged so `gd mesh bevel --edges tagged` can selectively bevel only the cut edges.
- **Grid-fill caps** — replaced earcut inner fan triangulation with grid-fill for quad-dominant cap topology. All generators (extrude, revolve, loft) now emit quads for side walls and multi-ring quad caps.
- **`gd mesh extrude-face`** — extrude selected faces along their normals by a given depth. Use `--where "y>0.4"` to select faces by spatial filter on centroid position.
- **`gd mesh boolean --count --spacing`** — array boolean: repeat a boolean operation N times with incremental offset. Useful for cutting repeating patterns (rail teeth, vent slits, magazine holes) in a single command.
- **`gd mesh profile --hole`** — multi-contour profiles with holes. Repeatable flag accepts hole polygons for hollow cross-sections (rings, frames). Earcut triangulates caps with holes natively.
- **`gd mesh bevel --where`** / **`--edges tagged`** — edge-selective bevel via spatial filter or boolean boundary tags.
- **`gd mesh inset --where`** — face-selective inset via spatial filter (e.g. `--where "z<-0.3"` insets only back faces).
- **`gd mesh flip-normals --where`** — flip normals on faces matching a spatial filter.
- **Spatial filter system** (`--where` flag) — shared `axis op value` expressions (e.g. `y>0.12`, `z<=-0.5`) for face centroid and edge midpoint filtering. Used by `bevel`, `inset`, `extrude-face`, and `flip-normals`.
- **Multi-ring concentric cap topology** — circle/polygon caps with >= 5 vertices now generate N concentric quad rings (auto: `max(1, n_pts/8)`, capped at 3) instead of a single fan triangulation. Eliminates pole singularity for UV unwrapping.
- **Quad-ring cap topology for revolve and loft** — consistent with extrude caps.
- **Mesh command recording & replay** — `gd mesh replay` replays recorded JSONL command sequences for reproducible builds.
- **Part groups** — `gd mesh group`, `ungroup`, `groups` for batch operations on named sets of parts.
- **Per-response mesh stats** — all mesh commands now include `_stats` in JSON output (face count, quad/tri/ngon breakdown, boundary edges).
- **Material preset persistence** — presets (glass, metal, rubber, etc.) are stored and re-applied on push.
- **Transform bake** — transforms are baked into vertex positions for correct world-space boolean operations.
- **Overlap tier detection** — `gd mesh check` detects overlapping/floating parts with configurable margin.
- **Flat shading default** — new mesh sessions default to flat (per-face) shading instead of smooth.
- **Auto-focus** — part operations automatically focus the affected part.
- **`gd mesh overlay edges/off`** — toggle edge wireframe overlay in the Godot viewport. Edges are color-classified: boundary (red), sharp (yellow, >30° dihedral), interior (gray). X-ray style (depth test disabled). Hidden automatically during `gd mesh view` screenshots.
- **Camera keyboard shortcuts** — press 1–0 in the Godot viewport to switch camera angles (Front, Side, Top, Back, Left, Bottom, and four 3/4 views).
- **`HalfEdgeMesh::classified_edges()`** — extract deduplicated edges classified by type (boundary, sharp, interior) based on dihedral angle.

### Changed
- **Boolean output is now watertight and quad-dominant** — 0 boundary edges, 88-97% quad ratio across all tested primitive combinations (cube×cube, cylinder×cube, cube×cylinder, sphere×ngon).
- **Area-weighted vertex normals** — accumulates raw (unnormalized) Newell vectors instead of unit face normals. Degenerate zero-area faces get near-zero weight, preventing fallback normals from corrupting neighbors.
- **Bevel vertex caps emit quads** instead of triangle fans.
- **Solidify and merge preserve quad topology** — no longer triangulate during shell and merge operations.
- **Mesh subcommand count: 47** (was 42) — added `extrude-face`, `replay`, `group`, `ungroup`, `overlay`.
- **Transforms bake into vertices** — `translate`, `rotate`, `scale` now modify mesh vertex positions directly in Rust instead of round-tripping through Godot GDScript. Faster and more reliable.
- **Bevel vertex caps use concentric ring fill** — caps with 5+ vertices use `build_quad_cap_3d` (same as extrude/boolean caps) instead of paired fan, producing cleaner quad topology.

### Fixed
- **Boolean winding reversal hack removed** — the unconditional `poly.reverse()` in boolean output is gone. Rust-side CCW primitives eliminate the CW/CCW mismatch.
- **Boolean degenerate face merging** — thin sliver fragments from plane splitting at tangent intersections are merged with neighbors during dissolve, preventing fallback normals.
- **Boolean dissolve fallback** — if coplanar dissolution breaks watertightness, falls back to the raw (guaranteed watertight) mesh.
- **Bevel watertightness** — strip winding derived from half-edge direction instead of heuristic.
- **Bevel concave crash** — no longer panics on concave polygon bevels.
- **Snapshot data loss** — non-destructive bake eliminates `load()` cache issues during export.
- **Hole winding** in multi-contour profiles corrected.
- **Focus desync** between Rust `MeshState` and Godot scene.
- **Checkpoint restore** reliability improved.
- **`merge-verts --all`** now works across all parts.
- **`extrude-face` corruption** on complex meshes fixed.
- **`--parts` batch material** — fixed variable scope bug that skipped parts.
- **Boolean degenerate sliver filter** — Newell's method area check rejects near-zero-area polygon fragments from plane splitting.
- **Dissolve multi-loop fallback** — when coplanar dissolution produces multiple boundary loops (hole through a face), falls back to original fragment faces instead of producing invalid polygons with holes.

## [0.2.20] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **`--no-color` flag and `NO_COLOR` env** — disable ANSI color codes in all CLI output. Useful for piping, AI agent tools, and terminal emulators that don't render ANSI (e.g. Claude Code VS Code panel).
- **`gd lsp references --name` CSV support** — pass comma-separated symbol names (`--name "foo,bar,baz"`) to search for multiple symbols in one call.
- **Async eval support** — `gd debug eval` now handles GDScript coroutines. Expressions returning `Signal` (from `await`) are automatically awaited. Timer re-entrance during async awaits is prevented with a polling guard.
- **`gd mesh` command** — procedural 3D mesh editing for Godot via CLI. 42 subcommands for building meshes from 2D profiles, primitives, and transforms without leaving the terminal. Designed for AI agent workflows with JSON output and batch execution.
  - **Workspace**: `init` (create workspace scene), `create` (bootstrap session with camera rig and optional primitive)
  - **Geometry**: `profile` (define 2D polygon on a plane, `--copy-profile-from` for reuse, `--shape circle` for circle/arc profiles), `extrude` (with `--segments N`), `revolve` (with `--cap`, `--degrees`), `taper` (with `--from-scale`/`--to-scale`, `--from`/`--to` range, `--midpoint`), `bevel` (with `--edges all|depth|profile`, `--profile 0.0–1.0` for concave→convex), `subdivide` (edge midpoint, each triangle → 4), `loop-cut` (axis-aligned plane cut), `move-vertex`
  - **Boolean operations**: `boolean --mode subtract|union|intersect --tool <part>` with split-and-classify algorithm, vertex welding, and Moller-Trumbore ray-triangle intersection
  - **Modifiers**: `inset` (shrink faces inward by factor), `solidify` (shell thickness via offset + stitch), `merge-verts` (remove duplicate vertices within distance threshold), `array` (linear duplication with offset)
  - **Parts**: `add-part` (named sub-parts from empty or primitives), `focus` (switch active / `--all`), `remove-part`, `duplicate-part` (`--mirror x|y|z` with position negation, `--symmetric` auto-offset), `info` (`--all` with world-space AABB and transforms), `describe` (one-shot debrief with composite views)
  - **Transforms**: `translate` (`--relative`, `--relative-to <part>`), `rotate`, `scale` (`--remap` re-center)
  - **Materials**: `material` (hex/named color, `--preset glass|metal|rubber|chrome|paint|wood|matte|plastic`, `--parts` glob/comma list)
  - **Normals**: `fix-normals` (auto-detect outward via majority vote, `--all`), `flip-normals` (reverse winding, `--caps x|y|z`, `--all`)
  - **Shading**: `shade-smooth` (averaged vertex normals), `shade-flat` (per-face faceted), `auto-smooth` (smooth below angle threshold)
  - **Viewing**: `view` (7 orthographic + 7 isometric angles, `--zoom`, `--normals` debug overlay, `--focus`), `list-vertices` (`--region` bounding box filter)
  - **State**: `checkpoint` (`--name`), `restore` (`--name`), `snapshot` (export to `.tscn` with materials and transforms)
  - **Utilities**: `reference` (validate reference image), `batch` (execute JSON command array), `check` (detect floating/disconnected parts with `--margin`)
  - **Half-edge mesh engine**: 15 core modules — `half_edge`, `profile`, `extrude`, `revolve`, `bevel`, `taper`, `subdivide`, `loop_cut`, `array`, `merge`, `mirror`, `normals`, `boolean`, `inset`, `solidify`, `loft`

### Fixed
- **`fix-normals` all-inverted detection** — replaced single seed-face centroid heuristic with majority vote across all faces. Now correctly detects and fixes meshes where 100% of normals are inverted.
- **`remove-part` state desync** — now removes the part from Rust `MeshState` after the Godot node is removed. Prevents `--all` operations (auto-smooth, fix-normals, etc.) from crashing on stale part references.
- **`duplicate-part --mirror x` position negation** — now negates `transform.position` on the mirror axis, so `--mirror x` places the duplicate at the opposite X position instead of the same position.
- **`--parts` comma-separated glob patterns** — `--parts "intake-*,headlight-*,taillight-*"` now correctly matches all three patterns. Previously only matched the first glob when the string contained both commas and wildcards.

## [0.2.19] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **`unnamed-node` lint rule** (godot, opt-in) — detects `add_child()` calls where a dynamically created node (via `.new()`) has no `.name` set, making it harder to find in the scene tree at runtime.
- **`infer-unknown-member` lint rule** (type_safety) — detects `var x := obj.member` where `obj` has a declared engine type but `member` is not a known property, method, or signal on that type. Godot's parser cannot infer the type and throws a parse error; this rule catches it at lint time.
- **`--rule` flag now force-enables opt-in rules** — `gd lint --rule <name>` activates the specified rule even if it's opt-in or disabled, instead of only post-filtering results.
- **Inline suppression docs** — `gd lint --help` and `gd man lint` now document the `# gd:ignore` / `# gd:ignore-next-line` / `# gd:ignore[rule]` suppression comment syntax. Also added to `gd llm` output for AI agent discoverability.
- **ClassDB signals table** — the generated class database now includes signal names (e.g., `value_changed`, `pressed`), used by lint rules to distinguish signals from unknown members.
- **`gd debug eval --file`** — read eval script from a file instead of `--expr`. Supports `--file -` for stdin. Preserves tabs and indentation, enabling loops/if/else blocks that can't be expressed in single-line `--expr`.

### Improved
- **Concurrent eval server** — the TCP eval server now accepts multiple simultaneous connections via a queue. One instance can install a persistent node (e.g., walk controller) while another queries game state. Node-based scripts are queued and executed next frame; RefCounted scripts execute immediately. Previously, the server only handled one eval at a time.
- **Dot-completions for builtin types** — `position.x`, `diff.length()`, `dir.normalized()` and other member accesses on inherited properties, binary expressions, and chained method calls now return correct completions. Type inference follows the full chain: inherited member → ClassDB property type → builtin member return type → progressive local variable resolution.

### Fixed
- **Multi-statement eval now returns results** — `gd eval` and `gd debug eval` with multi-statement input (semicolons or newlines) now smart-wraps the last expression with `return`. Handles var declarations, assignments, void calls, and explicit `return` without double-wrapping.
- **Game logs no longer leak into eval output** — eval output capture now uses begin/end markers so only prints from the eval script are shown, not concurrent game output (e.g. `[ClientController]` logs).
- **Eval errors now include details** — compilation and runtime errors from the eval server now include Godot's actual error messages instead of generic "Script compilation failed" or "GDScript error paused the game".
- **`gd debug screenshot` returns correct path on native Windows** — previously always converted to WSL `/mnt/c/...` path even on native Windows. Now only translates when actually running under WSL.
- **`callable-null-check` false positive on chained access** — `server.validator.is_valid()` guarding `server.validator.call()` no longer triggers a warning. The rule now recursively collects identifiers from nested attribute chains.
- **`parameter-shadows-field` false positive on static functions** — static factory methods like `static func from_box(id: int)` matching a field name no longer warn, since static methods have no `self`.
- **`replace-symbol` preserves indentation in inner classes** — replacing a symbol inside an inner class now re-indents the new content to match the original depth.
- **`result = ...` eval convention restored** — `gd debug eval --expr "result = 'hello'"` works again. Single-expression assignments to `result` are detected and wrapped with `var result` + `return result` instead of invalid `return result = ...`.
- **Eval semicolons in comments no longer corrupt `--file` scripts** — files with `;` in GDScript comments (e.g. bash loop examples) are now split on newlines, not semicolons. Newline splitting takes priority for multi-line input.
- **Breakpoint reason included in eval error messages** — when an eval script triggers a GDScript error, the `debug_enter` reason from Godot (e.g. the actual error text) is now captured and shown instead of generic "GDScript error paused the game".
- **Daemon startup race on Windows** — state file is now written immediately after port binding (before building workspace index), and the client retries for up to 5s instead of failing on first connection error.
- **`use-before-assign` false positives on Node subclasses** — members assigned in `_ready()` or `_init()` (directly or transitively through called methods) are now recognized as initialized in other methods. Previously, procedural UI code that assigned members in `_build_ui()` called from `_ready()` would produce spurious warnings.
- **`use-before-assign` false positives on null-guarded members** — bare identifier reads (`if member:`, `if not member: return`, `if x == member`) are no longer flagged as use-before-assign. Only dereference reads (`.prop`, `[idx]`) are reported. Additionally, members that are null-checked before being dereferenced are automatically suppressed.
- **`delete-symbol --line` no longer matches enclosing function** — `--line N` pointing to a statement inside a function body now correctly reports "no declaration found" instead of deleting the entire enclosing function. Only the declaration start line matches.
- **`native-method-override` no longer flags user-defined base class methods** — overriding methods from user-defined base classes (e.g., State pattern `enter()`/`exit()`) is normal polymorphism. The rule now only flags overrides of engine-native (ClassDB) methods.
- **`print-statement` no longer flags `push_error()`/`push_warning()`** — these are Godot's structured logging (shown in debugger with stack traces), not debug prints. They belong in production code.
- **`todo-comment` word boundary matching** — markers like `BUG`, `XXX`, `WARNING` now require word boundaries. "Debug trail" no longer matches `BUG`, and `"xxx-1f"` no longer matches `XXX`.
- **Formatter keeps `# gd:ignore-next-line` attached** — `gd fmt` no longer inserts blank lines between a suppression comment and the declaration it targets (functions, signals, etc.).

## [0.2.18] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **LSP semantic index** — `WorkspaceIndex` now caches per-file `SymbolTable`, declaration index (symbol name → declaring files), and extends graph. Cross-file operations use indexed lookups instead of re-parsing all files on every request.
- **Inlay hints** (`textDocument/inlayHint`) — ghost text showing inferred types for `:=` variables and parameter names at call sites.
- **Signature help** (`textDocument/signatureHelp`) — function signature with active parameter highlight as you type inside `(`. Triggers on `(` and `,`.
- **Call hierarchy** (`callHierarchy/incomingCalls`, `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls`) — "Who calls this?" and "What does this call?" for any function.
- **Find implementations** (`textDocument/implementation`) — find all subclasses of a class and all overrides of a method via the extends graph. Also available as `gd lsp find-implementations --name <method> [--base <class>]`.
- **Semantic tokens** (`textDocument/semanticTokens/full`) — type-aware syntax highlighting: classes, enums, functions, signals, variables, parameters, and engine types get distinct token types.
- **Workspace symbol search** (`workspace/symbol`) — fuzzy search across all project symbols (Ctrl+T / Cmd+T in VS Code).

### Improved
- **Hover shows origin** — cross-file member hovers now show which class/file the symbol comes from (e.g., `*VehicleData*`). Hovering `extends ClassName` now resolves to the class definition with file origin.
- **Symbols show signatures** — `gd lsp symbols` detail field now shows actual declarations (`func(params) -> ret`, `var name: Type`, `signal name(params)`, enum members) instead of just kind names.
- **Rename includes context** — `gd lsp rename --dry-run` edits now include the source line for each change, matching the references output format.
- **Completions deduplicated** — symbols from the current file no longer appear twice (once local, once from workspace scan).
- **References pre-filter** — cross-file reference search skips files that don't contain the target identifier text before parsing, reducing unnecessary tree-sitter parses.

### Fixed
- **`safe-delete-file` no longer deletes without `--force`** — previously, unreferenced files were auto-deleted even without `--force`. Now only reports references by default; `--force` is required to actually delete.
- **Refactor commands preserve annotations** — `replace-symbol`, `delete-symbol`, `move-symbol`, and `insert` now include preceding `@rpc`, `@export`, `@onready`, and other annotations when computing a symbol's full range. Previously, annotations on their own line (e.g. `@rpc("any_peer")` above a function) were orphaned or duplicated during refactoring.
- **Windows build** — added missing `Win32_System_IO` feature to `windows-sys` dependency.

## [0.2.17] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **`gd log` ring buffer** — game output (`print()`, `push_error()`, `push_warning()`) is now captured via the debug protocol into a 2000-entry in-memory ring buffer. View with `gd log` (default: last 50 lines), `--follow` for real-time tail, `--errors` for errors/warnings only, `--grep <pattern>` for filtering, `--json` for structured output, `--clear` to reset.
- **Eval output capture** — `gd eval` in REPL mode now captures and displays `print()` output, `push_error()` (red), and `push_warning()` (yellow) from the evaluated script. Non-void expressions return instantly; void calls poll for up to 1.5s to collect output.

### Changed
- **TCP eval IPC is non-blocking by default** — `send_eval()` (used by automation commands) does an instant drain (~2ms overhead) instead of polling for output. `send_eval_with_output()` (used by the REPL) polls for captured output on void calls.

### Removed
- **`gd run --log` flag** — replaced by `gd log` which uses the debug protocol ring buffer instead of file-based stdout/stderr piping. The ring buffer approach is more reliable (no file race conditions on WSL), captures structured output types (errors vs warnings vs log), and works across `gd stop`/restart cycles.
- **`ctrlc` dependency** — no longer needed after removing `tail_log_file`.

## [0.2.16] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Game automation API (phase 2)** — 10 new `gd debug` subcommands for driving a running game by node name/path:
  - `describe` — AI-readable snapshot: player position, nearby nodes with class/groups/distance, current scene, input actions. Auto-detects common player names, adjusts radius for 2D vs 3D.
  - `find` — locate nodes by `--name` (recursive), `--type` (class), or `--group`.
  - `get-prop` — read a property value by node name/path or object ID.
  - `set` — set a property using GDScript expressions (`Vector2(100, 200)`, `"Game Over"`, `200`). No object ID needed.
  - `call` — invoke a method on a node with JSON args array.
  - `navigate` — pathfind via NavigationAgent2D/3D. Sets target, polls until arrival or timeout. The game's own movement code handles physics and animations.
  - `await` — poll until a condition is met: node exists/removed, property `--equals`/`--gt`/`--lt`/`--contains`. Configurable `--timeout` and `--interval`.
  - `mouse-move` — move cursor to screen coordinates or a node's screen position (renamed from `move-to`).
  - `mouse-drag` — multi-step cursor drag between coordinates or nodes (renamed from `drag`).
  - `mouse-hover` — hover cursor over a node/position with configurable dwell time (renamed from `hover`).

### Changed
- **`gd debug eval` now uses full GDScript by default** — previously used Godot's Expression class (no loops, if, var). Now uses the file-based eval server, supporting arbitrary GDScript including loops, conditionals, and variable declarations. Add `--bare` to use the old Expression class behavior (needed for reading local variables at a breakpoint). Also adds `--timeout` flag (default 10s).
- **TCP eval IPC replaces file-based** — the eval server now uses direct TCP (4-byte length-prefixed protocol) instead of filesystem polling. Eliminates transient `ENOENT` on WSL, stale files surviving `gd stop`, and 100ms+ round-trip overhead. Port discovery via `{pid}:{port}` in the ready file. Use `gd run --file-ipc` or `GD_EVAL_FILE_IPC=1` for the old file-based transport.

### Fixed
- **Node2D screen position** — `mouse-move`/`mouse-drag`/`mouse-hover` targeting a Node2D now apply the viewport canvas transform, so coordinates are correct when a Camera2D has panned or zoomed.
- **Hold commands detect game exit** — `press/key/click --hold` and `type --delay` now poll the eval-ready file during the hold/delay instead of a blind sleep. If the game exits mid-hold, the command exits immediately with an error instead of lingering as an orphaned process.
- **Eval server crash recovery** — if a GDScript eval errors during `run()`, the eval server now clears its internal state first, so it never gets permanently stuck. Previously, a runtime error could leave the server in a state where it ignored all subsequent eval requests.
- **Navigate finish detection** — `gd debug navigate` now uses distance-based finish detection (< 25 units from target) in addition to `is_navigation_finished()`. Also detects stalled position (no movement for 1s while close). Godot's `is_navigation_finished()` uses a very tight tolerance and can return false even when the node is visually at the destination.
- **Concurrent eval safety** — stale eval file cleanup now only purges files older than 30 seconds, preventing deletion of result files from concurrent eval calls (e.g., agent running navigate polls alongside other eval commands).
- **Debug break auto-recovery** — when an eval script triggers a GDScript runtime error that pauses the game via the debugger, `gd` now detects the debug break, grabs the stack trace, sends `continue` to resume the game, and returns the error. Previously, a debug break would freeze the eval server indefinitely with a cryptic timeout message.
- **Eval server RefCounted fix** — the eval server now uses `script.new()` instead of `Node.new()` + `set_script()`, correctly handling scripts that extend RefCounted. Previously, non-Node scripts would crash the eval server with "Script inherits from RefCounted" and trigger a debug break.
- **Eval server startup cleanup** — the eval server now purges stale request/result files during initialization, preventing leftover files from a previous session (e.g., when `gd stop` couldn't delete them due to Windows file locking on WSL).
- **WSL file write retry** — eval request file writes retry once on transient `ENOENT` errors, which can occur on WSL under rapid cross-filesystem I/O (e.g., navigate polling every 200ms).
- **Void call detection via ClassDB** — `return print(...)`, `return node.set_pause(...)`, and other void-returning calls no longer trigger a `SCRIPT ERROR` that freezes the game. The eval wrapper now checks 16,346 methods from Godot's ClassDB to detect void returns and omits the `return` keyword. Builtin void functions (`print`, `push_error`, etc.) are also handled.
- **Better eval syntax errors** — `pre_check` now reports line number, column, and surrounding code for parse errors instead of a bare "Script has syntax errors" message.
- **WSL TCP partial read fix** — the eval server now uses `get_partial_data()` in a loop with a 2-second timeout instead of `get_data()`, which could return truncated scripts on WSL cross-VM TCP connections.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **`gd resource` command** — full CRUD API for `.tres` resource files (7 subcommands): `create`, `set-property`, `get-property`, `remove-property`, `set-script`, `remove-script`, `info`. All write commands support `--dry-run`. Create supports `--script` to attach a script at creation time.
- **StringName (`&"..."`) parse fix** — `.tscn`/`.tres` files containing `&"StringName"` literals now parse correctly. Previously tree-sitter byte offsets were misaligned when `&"` was normalized, causing mangled property values in `gd check`, `gd tree --scene`, `gd lsp scene-info`, and `gd resource info`.
- **LSP hover after dot** — `obj.method` now resolves the receiver's type and shows hover for the member on that type. Handles typed vars, `:=` inferred vars, autoloads, workspace `class_name` refs, and ClassDB inheritance chains.
- **LSP completions for local variable types** — `:=` inferred variables now resolve their type from constructor calls (`ClassName.new()`), class constants (`Vector2.ZERO`), builtin constructors (`Vector2(...)`), same-file function return types (`_get_direction() -> Vector2`), and literals.
- **LSP completions for for-loop typed iterators** — `for npc: Node2D in ...` now provides Node2D members when completing `npc.`.
- **LSP autoload completions** — `EventBus.`, `PokemonDB.` and other autoload singletons now return script-defined signals, methods, and properties plus inherited ClassDB members.
- **LSP Signal member completions** — `signal.emit()`, `.connect()`, `.disconnect()`, etc. now appear when completing after a signal name (e.g. `self.my_signal.` or `EventBus.player_moved.`).
- **LSP workspace class_name + autoload index** — `WorkspaceIndex` now indexes `class_name` declarations and `project.godot` autoloads for O(1) lookups.
- **LSP hover for engine singletons** — bare `Input`, `OS`, `Engine` etc. now show `class Input` on hover.
- **`--hold` for input commands** — `gd debug press/key/click --hold <seconds>` holds the input for a duration instead of a single-frame tap. Uses Rust-side sleep so the game processes physics frames during the hold. Essential for 3D games where single-frame presses barely register.
- **`--delay` for type command** — `gd debug type --delay <ms>` adds a delay between each character for more realistic typing.
- **Orphaned game cleanup** — when the daemon detects a binary rebuild (build_id mismatch), it now kills the orphaned game process before spawning a new daemon. Uses platform-native kill on all platforms (WSL: tasklist.exe + taskkill.exe, Linux/macOS: SIGTERM/SIGKILL, Windows: TerminateProcess).

### Fixed
- **LSP hover name collisions** — hovering on `obj.method` where `method` also exists in the current file now correctly resolves to the receiver's type instead of the local declaration.
- **LSP hover for method calls** — `obj.method()` (with parentheses) now resolves hover via tree-sitter `attribute_call` traversal, not just property access.
- **Eval ID collisions** — rapid-fire eval commands within 1ms got the same timestamp ID, causing overwrites. Now uses compound IDs (`{timestamp}-{pid}-{counter}`) with an atomic counter.
- **Per-ID eval request files** — changed from single `gd-eval-request.gd` (concurrent evals overwrite each other) to `gd-eval-request-{id}.gd` per request. GDScript server scans directory for any matching file.
- **Stale eval file cleanup** — `gd-eval-ready`, `gd-eval-request-*`, and `gd-eval-result-*` files are now cleaned up when the game exits or the daemon restarts.
- **Eval works during tree pause** — eval Timer and runner Node both set to `PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS`, so `gd eval` works while `SceneTree.paused = true`.
- **WSL game not killed on daemon restart** — `kill_daemon()` was sending Linux `kill` to a WSL shim PID instead of using `tasklist.exe`/`taskkill.exe` to find and kill the actual Windows Godot process.
- **Stale eval timeout cascading** — purge all `gd-eval-request-*` and `gd-eval-result-*` files before each new eval to prevent the eval server from processing leftover requests from timed-out evals. Ready file now validates PID liveness.
- **`gd lsp create-file` ignoring stdin** — piped content via `cat ... | gd lsp create-file --file <path>` was ignored, creating a bare stub file instead. Now checks `is_stdin_readable()` like other refactoring commands.
- **`gd scene attach-script` path resolution** — failed with "Script file not found" when run from a subdirectory. Now resolves relative paths against both CWD and project root, and strips `res://` prefixes.

### Changed
- **Human-readable defaults for all commands** — 22 LSP subcommands (refactoring, scene-info, find-implementations, diagnostics, code-actions) and `gd resource info` now default to concise human-readable output. Use `--format json` for structured output. Saves tokens for AI agents and is easier to scan for humans.
- **Eval server enabled by default** — `gd run` now starts the eval server automatically. `gd eval` and `gd debug` input commands work without any extra flags. Use `--bare` to opt out.
- **Eval output uses file redirect** — eval-without-log mode now redirects Godot's stdout/stderr to the log file via `Stdio::from(File)` instead of pipes, preventing broken-pipe crashes on WSL when the parent process exits.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Game liveness detection** — the daemon now checks every 5 seconds whether the game process is still alive. If the game crashes or exits without `gd stop`, the daemon automatically clears `game_running` and `game_pid` state instead of staying stuck forever.
- **Debug TCP disconnect callback** — when the game's debug TCP connection drops, the daemon immediately clears game state. Combined with liveness polling, this provides both instant and fallback detection.
- **Single-instance daemon (`flock`)** — the daemon now acquires an exclusive file lock (`.godot/gd-daemon.lock`) on startup. A second `gd daemon serve` for the same project exits with a clear error instead of silently competing.
- **Enriched `gd daemon status`** — response now includes `game_pid` and `debug_connected` fields alongside the existing `game_running`.
- **Platform-native process management** — `libc` (Unix) and `windows-sys` (Windows) replace shell-out to `kill`/`taskkill` for process liveness checks and game termination.
- **Faster WSL game stop** — replaced slow PowerShell `Get-CimInstance` lookup with `tasklist.exe /FI /FO CSV` for finding the Windows Godot PID.

### Changed
- **Unified game state** — `game_running` (AtomicBool) and `game_pid` (Mutex) merged into a single `game_state: Arc<Mutex<Option<GameInfo>>>`. Eliminates the class of bugs where one was set but the other wasn't.
- **Idle monitor interval** — reduced from 30s to 5s for faster crash detection and idle exit.

### Fixed
- **Daemon stuck after game crash** — the `game_running` flag stayed true forever when the game exited without `gd stop`, blocking idle timeout and confusing agents/scripts polling `gd daemon status`.
- **Stale PID accumulation** — `game_pid` was never cleared on unexpected game exit, leaving the state file pointing at a dead or reused PID.
- **`lsp_cmd.rs` Windows FFI** — replaced hand-rolled `extern "system" { fn GetFileType }` with proper `windows-sys` bindings.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Context-aware dot-completions** — typing `self.`, `sprite.`, or `Vector2.` now returns only members of the receiver type instead of the full 500+ global list. Resolves `self`/`super`, typed variables (top-level and local), function parameters, engine classes, builtin types, and workspace class names.
- **ClassDB properties** — extracted 4055 properties from Godot's `extension_api.json` into the class database. New `class_properties()` walks inheritance. Dot-completions show both methods and properties.
- **Human-readable LSP query output** — `gd lsp references/definition/hover/completions/symbols` now default to `--format human` with colored, tabular output. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output.
- **Enum member hover** — hovering over enum members shows computed values (e.g. `Color.RED = 0`), handles explicit and implicit value calculation.
- **Keyword hover** — hovering on `var`, `func`, `const`, `signal`, `class`, `enum` keywords (not just the name) now shows the declaration.
- **Input automation commands** — `gd debug click/press/key/type/wait/screenshot` for game input automation via live eval (experimental).
- **Shared live eval module** — extracted `send_eval()` to `src/core/live_eval.rs` for reuse by eval and input commands.
- **Completions `--kind` filter** — filter completion results by kind (function, method, variable, property, etc.).

## [0.2.12] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **LSP hover doc comments** — hovering over user-defined functions, variables, constants, signals, enums, and classes now shows `##` doc comments in the hover popup.
- **LSP completion doc comments** — completion items for user-defined symbols now include `##` doc comments in the documentation field.
- **Symbol table doc extraction** — `##` doc comments are parsed and stored on `FuncDecl`, `VarDecl`, `SignalDecl`, and `EnumDecl` in the symbol table, propagated to workspace index.

### Fixed
- **`replace-symbol` on `class_name` duplicated content** — replacing a symbol found via `class_name_statement` now replaces the entire file instead of just the `class_name` line, preventing old content from being appended below.
- **`naming-convention` false positive on private constants** — constants with leading underscores (e.g. `_DIALOG_BOX_SCRIPT`) are now correctly recognized as valid `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **`gd fmt` collapsed multiline enums** — enums written across multiple lines are now preserved as multiline, matching the existing behavior for arrays and dictionaries.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **`gd scene create`** — create new `.tscn` scene files with `--root-type` and optional `--root-name` (defaults to PascalCase of filename).
- **`gd scene add-node`** — add nodes to a scene with `--name`, `--type`, and optional `--parent` (defaults to root).
- **`gd scene remove-node`** — remove a node and all its descendants, with cascading cleanup of connections and orphaned ext_resources.
- **`gd scene set-property`** — set or update a property on any node (pass-through Godot resource format values).
- **`gd scene add-connection`** / **`gd scene remove-connection`** — add or remove signal connections with `--signal`, `--from`, `--to`, `--method`.
- **`gd scene detach-script`** — remove a script from a node, with automatic cleanup of orphaned ext_resources and load_steps.
- All scene commands support `--dry-run` to preview changes without writing.

### Changed
- `scene_cmd.rs` split into a directory module (`scene_cmd/`) with 8 submodules for maintainability.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **`gd eval`** — evaluate GDScript expressions, statements, or full scripts. Supports inline (`gd eval "1+1"`), file (`gd eval script.gd`), and stdin (`cat file.gd | gd eval -`). Offline mode launches headless Godot; live mode evaluates against a running game.
- **`gd run --eval`** — start the game with an embedded eval server. Enables `gd eval` to run arbitrary GDScript against the live game (query state, mutate objects, add nodes in real-time).
- **`gd test --runner`** — explicitly select test framework (`gut`, `gdunit4`, or `script`) instead of relying on auto-detection.
- **Eval sandbox** — blocks dangerous APIs (`OS.execute`, `HTTPClient`, `Thread`, etc.) and restricts `FileAccess`/`DirAccess` to `res://` and `user://` paths. Use `--unsafe` to bypass.
- **Escape sanitization** — auto-strips invalid GDScript escape sequences (e.g. `\!` → `!`) before sending to Godot, preventing silent crashes.
- **Syntax-highlighted eval output** — scripts sent via live eval are printed with line numbers and keyword/string/number coloring.

### Fixed
- **Stdin consumed twice in `gd eval -`** — piped input was read by the live eval path, then the offline fallback tried to re-read empty stdin. Now reads once and reuses.
- **Daemon state lost after rebuild** — rebuilding `gd` auto-restarted the daemon (build ID mismatch), losing eval server tracking. Now falls back to checking the `gd-eval-ready` file directly.
- **Eval timer killed by cleanup scripts** — the polling timer was auto-named `@Timer@2` and caught by `@`-prefix cleanup. Now named `GdEvalTimer`.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **`class-definitions-order` false positives** — `@rpc` annotations and `@export_group`/`@export_category`/`@export_subgroup` are no longer miscategorized as file-level headers. Only `@tool`, `@icon`, `@static_unload` are treated as headers; export grouping annotations are treated as export vars; `@rpc` and others are skipped.
- **`gd fmt` preserves inline `# gd:ignore` comments** — trailing comments on `signal`, `var`, `const`, `extends`, `class_name`, `return`, and assignment statements are no longer moved to a separate line, which previously broke lint suppression.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **`gd env`** — show environment info (gd version, Godot version/path, OS, arch, WSL, project root, config path). Supports `--json`.
- **Updated `gd llm`** — command reference now covers all 30 commands including debug, scene, log, env, and lint categories.

### Fixed
- **`gd debug eval` now works without a manual breakpoint** — previously always failed because the `break` command pauses the engine without entering the GDScript debug loop. Now automatically sets a temporary breakpoint on a `_process` function, evaluates, then cleans up. Assignments, node paths, builtins, and multi-expression all work.
- **Eval text output** — fixed raw JSON leaking into display for all types; Array and Dictionary values now render as `[1, true, null]` and `{key: value}` instead of nested variant JSON.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd scene attach-script`** — attach a GDScript file to a node in a `.tscn` scene. Auto-increments `ext_resource` ID, updates `load_steps`, supports `--node <name>` and `--dry-run`.
- **`gd run --log`** — stream Godot's stdout/stderr to the terminal for debugging print output and error backtraces
- **`gd log`** — view game output from the last `gd run`. Supports `--tail N`, `--follow` (real-time), and `--clear`.
- **Always-capture game logs** — `gd run` now always writes Godot's stdout/stderr to `.godot/gd-game.log`, even without `--log`. When `--log` is set, output is tee'd to both the terminal and the log file.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **New lint rule: `enum-name-collision`** (75 → 76 total) — detects when an inner enum name collides with a global `class_name` in the project, which causes Godot type resolution errors

### Fixed
- `gd check` now detects `:=` Variant inference from polymorphic builtins (`max`, `min`, `clamp`, `snapped`, `wrap`)
- Type inference engine now correctly returns Variant for polymorphic builtins (typed variants like `maxi`/`maxf` still return their specific types)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Lint categories** — 8 categories for bulk rule control: `correctness`, `suspicious`, `style`, `complexity`, `performance`, `godot`, `type_safety`, `maintenance`. Each of the 76 rules belongs to exactly one category.
- **Category config in `[lint]`** — set `type_safety = "warning"` to enable all type-safety rules (including opt-in), `maintenance = "off"` to disable all maintenance rules, etc.
- **5-level severity resolution** — disabled_rules > per-rule severity > per-rule config > category level > rule default

### Changed
- `gd init` template rewritten to be minimal with category examples
- README lint section reorganized by category with bulk-control documentation

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Cross-file resolution engine** (`src/core/workspace_index.rs`) — Layer 3: project-wide symbol index that maps `class_name` declarations to their symbols, parses `project.godot` autoloads, and resolves `preload()` targets. Built once at lint time, shared read-only across parallel file linting.
- **3 new lint rules** (72 → 75 total):
  - `shadowed-variable-base-class` (opt-in) — local variable shadows a member of a user-defined base class
  - `static-called-on-instance` (default-on) — static method called on `self` or typed instance instead of the class
  - `missing-tool` (opt-in) — base class has `@tool` but this script does not
- **Enhanced existing rules with cross-file awareness:**
  - `return-value-discarded` — now detects user-defined non-void functions across files
  - `unsafe-void-return` — now detects user-defined void functions across files
  - `native-method-override` — now checks user-defined base class methods, not just ClassDB
- **Project-aware type inference** — `infer_expression_type_with_project()` resolves method return types from user-defined base classes before falling back to ClassDB

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- **Remove image processing dependencies** — removed `base64`, `png`, and `jpeg-encoder` crates. Screenshot commands now return PNG file paths instead of base64-encoded data. Reduces binary size by ~240 KB.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Expression type inference engine** (`src/core/type_inference.rs`) — Layer 2: infer types of any GDScript expression. Handles literals, constructors, builtin functions, self/ClassDB method calls (walks inheritance chain), operators, comparisons, casts, ternary, identifiers, subscript, and `$`/`get_node`.
- **ClassDB `method_return_type()`** — resolve return types for 16,346 engine methods with inheritance chain walking.
- **7 new lint rules** (65 → 72 total):
  - `narrowing-conversion` (opt-in, fixable) — float expression assigned to int-typed variable
  - `unsafe-void-return` (opt-in, fixable) — returning or assigning a void function call result
  - `return-value-discarded` (opt-in) — non-void call result unused as expression statement
  - `incompatible-ternary` (opt-in) — ternary branches have incompatible types
  - `standalone-ternary` (default-on) — ternary expression used as statement with result unused
  - `assert-always-true` (opt-in, fixable) — `assert(true)`, `assert(1)`, `assert("string")`
  - `assert-always-false` (opt-in, fixable) — `assert(false)`, `assert(0)`, `assert(null)`
- 4 new auto-fixes (13 → 17 fixable rules): `narrowing-conversion` wraps with `int()`, `unsafe-void-return` splits return/removes var, `assert-always-true/false` deletes assertion line
- Refactored `static-type-inference`, `variant-inference`, and `untyped-array-literal` to use centralized inference engine (same diagnostics, consolidated implementation)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Symbol table** (`src/core/symbol_table.rs`) — per-file declaration-level type tracking built from tree-sitter ASTs. Extracts variables, functions, signals, enums, constants, annotations (`@tool`, `@onready`, `@export`, etc.), `class_name`, `extends`, inner classes, and type annotations.
- **6 new symbol-table-aware lint rules** (all opt-in):
  - `onready-with-export` (error) — `@onready` and `@export` on the same variable conflict at runtime
  - `enum-variable-without-default` (warning) — enum-typed variable without default will be `0`, not the first enum member
  - `redundant-static-unload` (warning) — `@static_unload` annotation with no static variables to unload
  - `get-node-default-without-onready` (error) — `$`/`get_node()` in variable default without `@onready`
  - `unused-private-class-variable` (warning) — `_`-prefixed variable declared but never referenced
  - `native-method-override` (error) — function name shadows a method inherited from an engine class
- Lint pipeline now builds symbol table once per file and passes it to all rules via `check_with_symbols()`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-14

### Breaking
- **Debug API grouping** — flat `gd debug <cmd>` commands reorganized into nested subcommand groups:
  - `gd debug scene tree` (was `scene-tree`), `gd debug scene inspect` (was `inspect`), `gd debug scene inspect-objects`, `gd debug scene camera-view`
  - `gd debug camera screenshot` (was `screenshot`), `gd debug camera override` (was `override-camera`), `gd debug camera transform-2d`, `gd debug camera transform-3d`
  - `gd debug live set-root` (was `live-set-root`), `gd debug live create-node`, etc.
  - `gd debug select type` (was `node-select-type`), `gd debug select clear` (was `clear-selection`), etc.
  - Top-level commands (`stop`, `continue`, `next`, `step-in`, `step-out`, `breakpoint`, `stack`, `vars`, `eval`, `set-prop`, `suspend`, etc.) remain unchanged

### Added
- **`enum-without-class-name` lint rule** (opt-in) — warns when a script defines a named enum but has no `class_name`, and a type annotation references that enum. Godot qualifies such enums as `filename.gd.EnumName`, so bare `EnumName` annotations fail to resolve.
- **`variant-inference` now detects compound expressions** — catches `:=` on binary/comparison operators (`dict["key"] == "switch"`), parenthesized expressions (`(dict["key"])`), and unary operators (`not dict["key"]`) that contain Variant-producing sub-expressions. Previously only direct subscript and method calls were detected.
- `gd check` mirrors the same Variant detection improvements (binary, parenthesized, unary)

## [0.1.31] - 2026-02-14

### Changed
- **Enforce `clippy::pedantic`** — deny-level pedantic lints across the entire codebase. Fixed 460+ violations (redundant closures, manual `is_empty`, needless borrows, `match` vs `if let`, etc.).
- **Remove DAP client** — stripped `dap_client.rs` and all DAP-specific code paths. The binary debug protocol (`godot_debug_server`) is the sole debug transport.
- **Split 7 god files into 43 submodules** — `debug_cmd` (10), `daemon` (6), `variant` (4), `test_cmd` (5), `godot_debug_server` (7), `printer` (6), `query` (5). No public API changes; all items re-exported from `mod.rs`. Every file now under 750 lines.

## [0.1.30] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd debug camera-view`** — show active camera info and all spatial node transforms in the running game. Detects cameras by engine class, script path, or node name (case-insensitive). Script classes (`res://...`) are included as spatial candidates and filtered by actual transform properties.
- **`gd debug screenshot`** — capture game viewport as JPEG (base64 via debug protocol, PNG→JPEG conversion). Supports `--output <file>` to save to disk.
- **`gd debug set-var`** — modify local variables at breakpoints (name + value + stack frame)
- **`gd debug inspect --rich`** — enrich output with ClassDB docs: class descriptions, property documentation, Godot docs URLs. Walks the full inheritance chain.
- **Property enrichment** — `inspect --rich` now resolves enum values to names, adds range metadata, and annotates type/resource hints from ClassDB

### Fixed
- **Debug server mutex deadlock** — all daemon dispatch functions now clone an `Arc<GodotDebugServer>` and release the daemon mutex before executing. Previously, long-running operations (batch inspect, accept) held the mutex for 10-30s, blocking all other debug queries and causing cascading timeouts.
- **Batch inspect reliability** — `cmd_inspect_objects` now issues individual inspect commands per object instead of a single batch send. Prevents one missing/freed object from breaking the entire batch.
- **`set-prop` with Vector3 values** — fixed `json_to_variant` catch-all that silently converted arrays/objects to Nil. Now maps JSON arrays by element count to Vector2/3/4/Transform/Basis/Projection, and JSON objects support typed wrappers like `{"Vector3": [1,2,3]}`.
- **`set-prop-field` sub-field assignment** — rewrote to use client-side inspect→modify→set instead of Godot's broken `fieldwise_assign` (which casts scalar values to the property type, zeroing sub-fields).
- **`eval` return values** — fixed 3-field vs 4-field parsing of Godot's `evaluation_return` protocol (was returning variant type ID instead of actual value).
- **Daemon kill race condition** — `kill_daemon` now polls for process exit (up to 2s) instead of a fixed 200ms sleep, preventing port conflicts on restart.
- **`accept()` interruptible** — debug server accept loop checks the `running` flag so server replacement interrupts pending accepts within ~50ms.
- **Screenshot size** — PNG→JPEG conversion (quality 80) via `png` + `jpeg-encoder` crates instead of raw PNG base64.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd llm`** — AI-readable command reference (like llms.txt for websites). Prints the full command tree in a compressed format for LLM context windows — 204 lines covering every command, flag, and pattern.
- **`gd debug inspect --rich`** — enrich inspect output with ClassDB documentation (class descriptions, property docs, Godot docs URLs). Walks the inheritance chain (e.g. CharacterBody3D → Node3D → Node → Object).
- `src/debug/enrich.rs` — loosely coupled enrichment module (JSON in → JSON out, easy to remove)

## [0.1.28] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd stop`** — top-level command to terminate the running game (mirrors `gd run`)
  - `gd debug stop` also works as an alias
  - WSL-aware: uses PowerShell + taskkill.exe to find and kill the Windows Godot process
  - Game PID persisted in daemon state file — `gd stop` works even if daemon has died
- **`gd debug inspect --brief`** — stripped-down output for AI: just `{name: value}` pairs, no Godot internals (hint, hint_string, type_id, usage)
- **`gd debug breakpoint --name <func>`** — resolve function name to file:line automatically (searches project .gd files)
- **`gd debug breakpoint --condition <expr>`** — condition metadata stored with breakpoint (server-side enforcement coming later)
- **`gd debug next` aliased as `gd debug step-over`** — symmetry with `step-in`/`step-out`

### Changed
- `gd debug suspend --resume` → `gd debug suspend --off` — consistent with `mute-audio --off`, `skip-breakpoints --off`, etc.
- `gd debug inspect` strips `Members/` and `Constants/` prefixes from property names — property names now match what `set-prop` expects
- `gd run` now always wires `--remote-debug` silently (no user-facing port args) — enables `gd debug` without manual setup
- `gd run` output cleaned up — single status line instead of raw JSON dump

### Fixed
- `gd daemon status` now correctly shows `game_running: true` when a game is connected via binary debug protocol (was only set for DAP launches)
- `gd stop` / `gd debug stop` clears the `game_running` flag in daemon state

## [0.1.27] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`gd daemon`** — top-level command for daemon lifecycle management
  - `gd daemon status` — show daemon connectivity and state
  - `gd daemon stop` — stop the background daemon
  - `gd daemon restart` — restart the daemon (stop + auto-spawn on next query)
  - Moved from `gd lsp daemon-*` namespace since the daemon is no longer LSP-specific
- **WSL path translation** — `gd run` and `gd build` now work transparently from WSL with a Windows Godot binary
  - `find_godot()` resolves Windows paths in `gd.toml`/`GODOT_PATH` on WSL (auto-converts `C:\...` to `/mnt/c/...` for existence checks)
  - `--path` argument auto-converted from `/mnt/c/...` to `C:/...` when spawning a `.exe` binary
  - Daemon cache lookup: discovers Godot path from previous DAP launches
  - Clear error message on WSL when no Windows Godot binary is configured
- **Daemon auto-restart** — build_id fingerprinting (version + binary mtime) auto-kills stale daemons after recompile
- **Game exit detection** — daemon auto-clears `game_running` flag when game process exits (no more stale state)

### Changed
- `gd run` simplified — non-blocking spawn (returns immediately instead of waiting for Godot to exit), removed DAP launch logic
- WSL path utilities consolidated into `src/core/fs.rs` (removed duplicates from run_cmd, daemon, debug_cmd)

## [0.1.26] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Godot binary debug protocol** — full implementation of Godot's native debug protocol (port 6007), enabling direct game introspection beyond what DAP supports
  - `src/debug/variant.rs` — binary codec for all 39 Godot Variant types (Nil through PackedVector4Array)
  - `src/debug/godot_debug_server.rs` — TCP server speaking the binary protocol (length-prefixed Variant-encoded packets)
- `gd debug scene-tree` — show the running game's live scene tree (node names, classes, object IDs)
- `gd debug inspect --id <N>` — inspect a scene node's properties by object ID
- `gd debug set-prop --id <N> --property <name> --value <val>` — set a property on a scene node at runtime
- `gd debug suspend [--off]` — freeze/resume the game loop
- `gd debug next-frame` — advance one physics frame while suspended
- `gd debug time-scale --scale <N>` — set Engine.time_scale (slow-mo, fast-forward)
- `gd debug reload-scripts` — hot-reload all GDScript files in the running game
- Interactive REPL commands: `scene-tree`/`tree`, `inspect`/`i`, `set-prop`, `suspend`, `resume`, `next-frame`/`nf`, `timescale`, `reload`
- All new commands support `--format json` for scripting

## [0.1.25] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `gd debug step-out` — step out of the current function (synthetic: repeats `next` until stack depth decreases, same technique as the official VS Code plugin)
- `gd debug --format json` on all stepping commands (`continue`, `next`, `step`, `step-out`, `pause`) — JSON output includes stack frames and full variable scopes
- `gd debug set-var --format json` — returns `{name, value, type, input}` for automation
- Client-side conditional breakpoints — `gd debug break --condition <expr>` now evaluates the expression on each hit and auto-continues when false (Godot's DAP ignores conditions natively)
- `--name` with `--file` scoping for ambiguous function names — errors with candidate list when multiple files define the same function
- Type inference for `set-var` — populates type field from value when Godot returns empty type (int, float, bool, String, constructors)

### Fixed
- `--name` now resolves to the first executable statement inside the function body (not the `func` declaration line, which Godot won't break on)
- Condition evaluator correctly parses boolean results (`"false"`, `"0"`, `"null"` → falsy; everything else → truthy)
- `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=` in eval expressions no longer trigger false assignment warnings
- `set-var` on local variables gives clear error: "Godot's DAP does not support setting locals"
- `set-var` and `eval` output JSON errors to stderr when `--format json` is active
- Daemon DAP recovery: failed operations set `dap_needs_reconnect` flag, next query auto-reconnects
- Daemon disconnect uses TCP shutdown to prevent stream corruption after failed operations
- String values in `set-var` correctly auto-quoted (bare words like `bike` become `"bike"`)

## [0.1.24] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `gd debug set-var --name <var> --value <val>` — modify variable values while paused at a breakpoint

## [0.1.23] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Background daemon** — persistent process maintains Godot LSP and DAP connections, auto-starts on first CLI query, auto-exits after 5 min idle
  - `gd lsp daemon-status` — show daemon connectivity (Godot LSP, DAP, game state)
  - All hover, completion, and definition queries now route through the daemon for instant results
- `gd run` now launches the game via DAP when the Godot editor is open (returns immediately, falls back to direct spawn)
- `gd debug` — runtime debugging via Godot's Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)
  - `gd debug attach` — interactive REPL session
    - `break`, `clear`, `wait` — set/clear breakpoints and wait for hits
    - `continue`, `pause`, `next`, `step` — execution control
    - `stack`, `vars`, `expand` — inspect call stack and variables
    - `eval` — evaluate expressions at breakpoints (member-access only)
  - `gd debug break --file <path> --line <N>` — one-shot: set breakpoint, wait for hit, dump stack + variables (`--format json`)
  - `gd debug break --name <func>` — break on function entry by name (resolves to file:line automatically)
  - `gd debug break --condition <expr>` — conditional breakpoints (only trigger when expression is true)
  - `gd debug eval --expr <expr>` — evaluate expression while paused at a breakpoint (`--format json`)
  - `gd debug continue/next/step/pause` — non-interactive execution control
  - `gd debug status` — show DAP connection and threads (`--format json`)
  - `gd debug stop` — terminate the running game
  - Cross-platform path resolution (WSL `/mnt/c/` to `C:/` conversion)
- Static completions now include engine methods from class_db based on `extends` clause (e.g. `extends Node2D` adds `apply_scale`, `add_child`, etc.)

### Fixed
- Godot Dictionary errors from missing `name`/`checksums` fields in DAP source objects
- Godot Dictionary errors from missing `context.triggerKind` in LSP completion requests

## [0.1.22] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `.tscn`/`.tres` scene and resource file support:
  - `gd check` validates scene files — detects broken `res://` paths, orphaned `ext_resource` declarations, and parse errors
  - `gd deps --include-resources` includes `.tscn`/`.tres` files in the dependency graph
  - `gd tree --scene <file.tscn>` displays scene node hierarchy (text tree or `--format json`)
  - `gd tree --scene <directory>` lists all scenes in a directory
  - `gd lsp scene-info --file <scene.tscn>` returns structured JSON (nodes, ext_resources, connections)
  - `gd lsp scene-info --nodes-only` for compact node-only output
- Godot LSP proxy — forwards hover, completion, and go-to-definition to Godot's built-in LSP server (port 6005) when the editor is running
  - `gd lsp --godot-port <PORT>` to configure proxy port (default: 6005)
  - `gd lsp --no-godot-proxy` to disable proxy
  - Results are merged with static analysis (engine docs + local symbols)

### Changed
- Integration tests split into 8 domain-specific files (check, commands, deps, fmt, lint, lsp_query, lsp_refactor, scene)

## [0.1.21] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- `gd lsp edit-range --range 5-20` shorthand for `--start-line 5 --end-line 20`
- `gd lsp create-file --input-file` reads initial file content from a file (or stdin when piped) instead of generating boilerplate

## [0.1.20] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- `gd fmt` preserves multiline parenthesized expressions with comments (no longer collapses `# comment` into subsequent code)
- `gd fmt` places commas correctly before trailing comments in multiline arrays and dictionaries
- `gd fmt` properly handles line continuation (`\`) in arrays, dictionaries, binary operators, assignments, function parameters, and method chains

## [0.1.19] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- `gd check` no longer rejects `#region`/`#endregion` fold markers at the top level
- `gd check` no longer flags Godot enum type names (e.g. `Viewport.MSAA`) as unknown constants
- `gd fmt` preserves multiline arrays and dictionaries instead of collapsing them into single lines

## [0.1.18] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- `untyped-array-literal` auto-fix now infers `Array[Color]`, `Array[Vector2]`, etc. from homogeneous class member/constructor expressions (not just String/int/float/bool)

  - `variant-inference` (opt-in) — warns on `:=` inferring Variant from dict/array access patterns
  - `look-at-before-tree` (opt-in) — detects tree-dependent method calls (`look_at`, `to_global`, etc.) before `add_child()`
  - `null-after-await` (opt-in) — warns on member variable access in `_process`/`_physics_process` without null guard after `await` assignment

- `monitoring-in-signal` lint rule (default on) — detects direct `monitoring`/`monitorable` assignment in Area2D/Area3D signal callbacks, suggests `set_deferred()`
- `gd lsp view` — read lines from a GDScript file with optional `--start-line`, `--end-line`, and `--context` (JSON output for AI tools)

### Fixed
- `gd lsp edit-range` on empty files no longer errors — correctly handles insert into empty/newline-only files
- `gd lsp change-signature` no longer inserts C-style `/* */` comments at call sites — uses default value or `null` placeholder with a warning

## [0.1.13] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- gdUnit4 test framework support in `gd test` — auto-detects `addons/gdUnit4/`, invokes GdUnitCmdTool, parses JUnit XML results

### Changed
- VS Code extension version bumped to 0.1.3 (esbuild bundling)

## [0.1.11] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Hover on member access (`foo.global_position`) shows builtin Godot member documentation with class, type, description, and docs link

- `--input-file <path>` flag for `insert`, `replace-body`, `replace-symbol`, `edit-range` — read content from a file instead of stdin (fixes Windows pipe encoding issues with tabs)

### Fixed
- Hover on unresolvable identifiers inside a function no longer falls through to show the enclosing function signature
- Hover on declaration keywords (`func`, `var`, `const`, `signal`, `class`, `enum`) only triggers when cursor is on the name, not on body contents
